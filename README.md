technion-LyX (Technion LyX Conspiracy)
============

Meeting on 26/6:
------------

Dear fellow LyXers,

If you're like us, you love LyX, and wish you could do everything from it:
- Write your papers with the conference style file
- Collaborate with LaTeX-only people
- Use it for a blog...

Problem: not everything works. Solution: report bugs and fix problems together, and eat pizza!

The plan on 26/6, 4 to 8 pm, in room 815 of the EE Mayer building:
- Lightning talks. Currently planned (you are invited to show us anything cool and not well known also!):
 - How to write Feynman diagrams in LyX (Ronen)
 - Moving a paper back from LaTeX, before and after bug reports (Daniel)
- A quick dev demo: how to report, find, solve and patch a simple bug that keeps a valid latex document from compiling under LyX.
- 3-4 hours of joint hacking, bug reporting and whatever we want.

Later:
Make a mailing list or forum for further discussion, a github project to share useful templates etc, and whatever else we find useful.

Before:
Please forward to any other LyX user in the area, let us know if you want to give a demo or have any other ideas. Let us know if you are interested in general and coming this time in particular.

Daniel Vainsencher and Ronen Abravanel

Hackathon project ideas

Frequency based autocompletion (Lior Ella proposed, DanielV wants too!)

Import unknown LaTeX environments as corresponding LyX layouts (DanielV)
